# Audio classification in R
Part of the tutorial to be published in my blog [poissonisfish](https://poissonisfish.com). Under development!

## Data
The data (*i.e.* 2150 MP3 files, 8GB) are part of the [xeno-canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org) collection and hosted in the public Kaggle dataset [Bird songs from Europe (xeno-canto)](https://www.kaggle.com/monogenea/birdsongs-from-europe), alongside an optional metadata CSV file. Rights to use and share them are listed under the [Terms of Use](https://www.xeno-canto.org/about/terms) page from xeno-canto.

## Acknowledgements
I want to thank the xeno-canto community for their work in collecting, documenting and sharing this wealth of information.
