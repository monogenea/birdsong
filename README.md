# Audio classification in R
Part of the tutorial to be published in my blog [poissonisfish](https://poissonisfish.com). Under development.

## Data
These data are part of the [xeno-canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org) collection. The audio data (*i.e.* 2150 MP3 files, 8GB), far too large to be hosted in GitHub, are hosted in the public Kaggle dataset [Bird songs from Europe (xeno-canto)](https://www.kaggle.com/monogenea/birdsongs-from-europe) alongside an optional metadata CSV file. Rights to use and share the data are fully described under the [Terms of Use](https://www.xeno-canto.org/about/terms) page from xeno-canto.

## Acknowledgements
I want to thank the xeno-canto community for their work in collecting, documenting and sharing this wealth of information.
